// This file is used to configure VS Code settings for the project.
// It specifies that code actions should be applied on save, including fixing all issues,
// organizing imports, and sorting members explicitly.
// The "explicit" value ensures that these actions are only applied when explicitly requested,
// rather than automatically on every save, allowing for more control over when these actions are performed.
// This can help maintain a clean and organized codebase while avoiding unintended changes during development.
